# atom-autoupdater
Scriptworks to automate Atom installating and updating on Linux distros in all channels.

# Overview
Currently, [Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/#updating-atom) doesn't support automatic update. There are unofficial atom package to do so, [here](https://atom.io/packages/atom-updater-linux) but that requires RPM or DPKG and doesn't support nightly release either. So, behold the __collider__ , a bunch of script to install latest updates, direct from cli.

- Change channel
