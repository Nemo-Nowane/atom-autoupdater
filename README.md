# atom-autoupdater
Scriptworks to automate Atom installating and updating on Linux distros in all channels.

# Overview
Currently, [Atom](https://flight-manual.atom.io/getting-started/sections/installing-atom/#updating-atom) doesn't support automatic update. There is unofficial atom package to do so, [here](https://atom.io/packages/atom-updater-linux) but that requires RPM or DPKG and doesn't support nightly releases. So, behold the __collider__ , a tool to do that, direct from cli.

__If you have Atom included in your disto's official repository and don't want to take risk, you better youse that__

# What it does:
- It can install Atom text editor in your linux installation
- Update existing installation
- Install or update from a specific channel (stable, beta, nightly)
- Notify about update
- Schedeule update
- Downgrade to an older release
- Change channel

# What it does't do
- Install atom packages

# Getting started
Download the repository in compressed format or run the command
```wget https://github.com/Nemo-Nowane/atom-autoupdater/archive/master.zip```
Then run ```./initialise```
